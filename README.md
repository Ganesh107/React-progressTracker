# React-progressTracker
Implemented a simple progress tracker which consists of 3 states start, progress and end, additional states can be added according to requirement.
Used useReducer() to maintain state at component level
Progress can be changed by clicking on each state 
(n+1)th state can be reached only after visiting the nth state
